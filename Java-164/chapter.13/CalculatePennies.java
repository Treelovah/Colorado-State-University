Write code to complete doublePennies()'s base case. Sample output for below program with inputs 1 and 10:

    Number of pennies after 10 days: 1024

Note: If the submitted code has an infinite loop, the system will stop running the code after a few seconds, and report "Program end never reached." 

The system doesn't print the test case that caused the reported message.
