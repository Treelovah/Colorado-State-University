* The domain describes all the independent values in a function.
* The Target describes the set of the mapped function
* The Range describes all the dependent values in a function
* A function is valid when each member of A points to a member of B
* Yes, all these functions are valid if their domain is the real numbers
* An Injective Function maps specific elements in its domain to distinct elements of the subdomain
* No, the above 8 are not injective.
* Yes, (5x + 1) is injective
* No, (abs(x)) is not injective
* The horizontal line test is how what we can apply to determine if a function is injective or not.
* A Surgective Function is a function that maps set A to set B. For every element a in A, there is atleast one element b in B.
* No, the above 8 functions are not all surgective
* Yes, 5x + 1 is surgective
* Yes, sin(x) is surgective
* No, 2^x is not surgective
* A Bijective Function is one that is both surgective and injective (both one-to-one & onto)
* h(x) and j(x) are bijective functions
